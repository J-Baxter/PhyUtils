GetEmpiricalXML allows the user to remove substitution, clock and tree parameters from a beauti XML
and instead run a trait analysis using a previously inferred posterior sample of phylogenetic trees.

The benefit of this approach is to reduce run-time, allowing proper inference of the phylogenetic
tree before starting a trait analysis.

The script runs a command line application as follows:
```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
python3 GetEmpiricalXML.py path/to/originalfile.xml path/to/empiricaltrees.tree
```
